### What I learned

This challenges helped me to feel way more confortable about the way I set-up margin and padding. I also used variable for the spacing which was very handy. I am started to see the potential of using variables, even for small projects like this, where I could easily play around with the secondary color that I wanted to use for this page.
I also used REM for the first time to make my code more accessible and adaptable.

### Continued development

I'd like to refine and increase my knowledge on animation and transition on :hover elements.

### Useful resources

- [Using Media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries) - This helped me for implementing media queries for bigger screens.
- [WAVVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) - This website ensures that you are developing an accessible website. It helped me to ensure that the secondary color I picked had a sufficient contrast ratio for all viewers.
